- `disable_shutdown` (bool) - Packer normally halts the virtual machine after all provisioners have
  run when no `shutdown_command` is defined. If this is set to `true`, Packer
  *will not* halt the virtual machine but will assume that the VM will shut itself down
  when it's done, via the preseed.cfg or your final provisioner.
  Packer will wait for a default of 5 minutes until the virtual machine is shutdown.
  The timeout can be changed using the `shutdown_timeout` option.

- `disk_size` (\*uint) - The size, in megabytes, of the primary hard disk
  for the VM. By default, this is the same as the cloned VM.

- `clone_from_vmcx_path` (string) - This is the path to a directory containing an exported virtual machine.

- `clone_from_vm_name` (string) - This is the name of the virtual machine to clone from.

- `clone_from_snapshot_name` (string) - The name of a snapshot in the
  source machine to use as a starting point for the clone. If the value
  given is an empty string, the last snapshot present in the source will
  be chosen as the starting point for the new VM.

- `clone_all_snapshots` (bool) - If set to true all snapshots
  present in the source machine will be copied when the machine is
  cloned. The final result of the build will be an exported virtual
  machine that contains all the snapshots of the parent.

- `differencing_disk` (bool) - If true enables differencing disks. Only
  the changes will be written to the new disk. This is especially useful if
  your source is a VHD/VHDX. This defaults to false.

- `copy_in_compare` (bool) - When cloning a vm to build from, we run a powershell
  Compare-VM command, which, depending on your version of Windows, may need
  the "Copy" flag to be set to true or false. Defaults to "false". Command:
