- `adapter_name` (string) - The name of the network adapter.
  By default, leaving this value unset will cause Packer to
  try and determine the switch to use by looking for an external switch
  that is up and running.

- `switch_name` (string) - The name of the switch for this adapter

- `vlan_id` (string) - This is the VLAN of the virtual switch's
  network card. By default, none is set. If none is set then a VLAN is not
  set on the switch's network card. If this value is set it should match
  the VLAN specified in by vlan_id.

- `mac_address` (string) - This allows a specific MAC address to be used on
  the default main virtual network card. The MAC address must be a string with
  no delimiters, for example "037777777777deadbeef".
