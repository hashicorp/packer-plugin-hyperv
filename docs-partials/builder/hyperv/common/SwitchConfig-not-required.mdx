- `switch_name` (string) - The name of the main switch to connect the virtual
  machine to. By default, leaving this value unset will cause Packer to
  try and determine the switch to use by looking for an external switch
  that is up and running.

- `switch_type` (string) - This allows the specification of the switch type.
  the default will be Internal if unspecificed

- `switch_vlan_id` (string) - This is the VLAN of the virtual switch's
  network card. By default, none is set. If none is set then a VLAN is not
  set on the switch's network card. If this value is set it should match
  the VLAN specified in by vlan_id.
