Type: `hyperv-iso`
Artifact BuilderId: `MSOpenTech.hyperv`

The Hyper-V Packer builder is able to create
[Hyper-V](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/server-cloud/solutions/virtualization.aspx)
virtual machines and export them, starting from an ISO image.

The builder builds a virtual machine by creating a new virtual machine from
scratch. Typically, the VM is booted, an OS is installed, and software is
provisioned within the OS. Finally the VM is shut down. The result of the
Hyper-V builder is a directory containing all the files necessary to run
the virtual machine portably.

## Basic Example

Here is a basic example. This example is not functional. It will start the OS
installer but then fail because we don't provide the preseed file for Ubuntu
to self-install. Still, the example serves to show the basic configuration:

```json
{
  "type": "hyperv-iso",
  "iso_url": "http://releases.ubuntu.com/12.04/ubuntu-12.04.5-server-amd64.iso",
  "iso_checksum": "md5:769474248a3897f4865817446f9a4a53",
  "ssh_username": "packer",
  "ssh_password": "packer",
  "shutdown_command": "echo 'packer' | sudo -S shutdown -P now"
}
```

By default Packer will perform a hard power off of a virtual machine.
However, when a machine is powered off this way, it is possible that
changes made to the VMs file system may not be fully synced, possibly
leading to corruption of files or lost changes. As such, it is important to
add a `shutdown_command`. This tells Packer how to safely shutdown and
power off the VM.

## ISO Configuration Reference

<!-- Code generated from the comments of the ISOConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/iso_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

By default, Packer will symlink, download or copy image files to the Packer
cache into a "`hash($iso_url+$iso_checksum).$iso_target_extension`" file.
Packer uses [hashicorp/go-getter](https://github.com/hashicorp/go-getter) in
file mode in order to perform a download.

go-getter supports the following protocols:

* Local files
* Git
* Mercurial
* HTTP
* Amazon S3

Examples:
go-getter can guess the checksum type based on `iso_checksum` length, and it is
also possible to specify the checksum type.

In JSON:

```json

	"iso_checksum": "946a6077af6f5f95a51f82fdc44051c7aa19f9cfc5f737954845a6050543d7c2",
	"iso_url": "ubuntu.org/.../ubuntu-14.04.1-server-amd64.iso"

```

```json

	"iso_checksum": "file:ubuntu.org/..../ubuntu-14.04.1-server-amd64.iso.sum",
	"iso_url": "ubuntu.org/.../ubuntu-14.04.1-server-amd64.iso"

```

```json

	"iso_checksum": "file://./shasums.txt",
	"iso_url": "ubuntu.org/.../ubuntu-14.04.1-server-amd64.iso"

```

```json

	"iso_checksum": "file:./shasums.txt",
	"iso_url": "ubuntu.org/.../ubuntu-14.04.1-server-amd64.iso"

```

In HCL2:

```hcl

	iso_checksum = "946a6077af6f5f95a51f82fdc44051c7aa19f9cfc5f737954845a6050543d7c2"
	iso_url = "ubuntu.org/.../ubuntu-14.04.1-server-amd64.iso"

```

```hcl

	iso_checksum = "file:ubuntu.org/..../ubuntu-14.04.1-server-amd64.iso.sum"
	iso_url = "ubuntu.org/.../ubuntu-14.04.1-server-amd64.iso"

```

```hcl

	iso_checksum = "file://./shasums.txt"
	iso_url = "ubuntu.org/.../ubuntu-14.04.1-server-amd64.iso"

```

```hcl

	iso_checksum = "file:./shasums.txt",
	iso_url = "ubuntu.org/.../ubuntu-14.04.1-server-amd64.iso"

```

### Required:

<!-- Code generated from the comments of the ISOConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/iso_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

- `iso_checksum` (string) - The checksum for the ISO file or virtual hard drive file. The type of
  the checksum is specified within the checksum field as a prefix, ex:
  "md5:{$checksum}". The type of the checksum can also be omitted and
  Packer will try to infer it based on string length. Valid values are
  "none", "{$checksum}", "md5:{$checksum}", "sha1:{$checksum}",
  "sha256:{$checksum}", "sha512:{$checksum}" or "file:{$path}". Here is a
  list of valid checksum values:
   * md5:090992ba9fd140077b0661cb75f7ce13
   * 090992ba9fd140077b0661cb75f7ce13
   * sha1:ebfb681885ddf1234c18094a45bbeafd91467911
   * ebfb681885ddf1234c18094a45bbeafd91467911
   * sha256:ed363350696a726b7932db864dda019bd2017365c9e299627830f06954643f93
   * ed363350696a726b7932db864dda019bd2017365c9e299627830f06954643f93
   * file:http://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/SHA256SUMS
   * file:file://./local/path/file.sum
   * file:./local/path/file.sum
   * none
  Although the checksum will not be verified when it is set to "none",
  this is not recommended since these files can be very large and
  corruption does happen from time to time.

- `iso_url` (string) - A URL to the ISO containing the installation image or virtual hard drive
  (VHD or VHDX) file to clone.

<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the ISOConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/iso_config.go; -->


### Optional:

<!-- Code generated from the comments of the ISOConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/iso_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

- `iso_urls` ([]string) - Multiple URLs for the ISO to download. Packer will try these in order.
  If anything goes wrong attempting to download or while downloading a
  single URL, it will move on to the next. All URLs must point to the same
  file (same checksum). By default this is empty and `iso_url` is used.
  Only one of `iso_url` or `iso_urls` can be specified.

- `iso_target_path` (string) - The path where the iso should be saved after download. By default will
  go in the packer cache, with a hash of the original filename and
  checksum as its name.

- `iso_target_extension` (string) - The extension of the iso file after download. This defaults to `iso`.

## Configuration Reference

There are many configuration options available for the Hyper-V builder. They
are organized below into two categories: required and optional. Within each
category, the available options are alphabetized and described.

In addition to the options listed here, a
[communicator](/packer/docs/templates/legacy_json_templates/communicator) can be configured for this
builder.

### Optional:

- `output_directory` (string) - This setting specifies the directory that
artifacts from the build, such as the virtual machine files and disks,
will be output to. The path to the directory may be relative or
absolute. If relative, the path is relative to the working directory
`packer` is executed from. This directory must not exist or, if
created, must be empty prior to running the builder. By default this is
"output-BUILDNAME" where "BUILDNAME" is the name of the build.

<!-- Code generated from the comments of the Config struct in builder/hyperv/iso/builder.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

- `disable_shutdown` (bool) - Packer normally halts the virtual machine after all provisioners have
  run when no `shutdown_command` is defined. If this is set to `true`, Packer
  *will not* halt the virtual machine but will assume that the VM will shut itself down
  when it's done, via the preseed.cfg or your final provisioner.
  Packer will wait for a default of 5 minutes until the virtual machine is shutdown.
  The timeout can be changed using the `shutdown_timeout` option.

- `disk_size` (uint) - The size, in megabytes, of the hard disk to create
  for the VM. By default, this is 40 GB.

- `use_legacy_network_adapter` (bool) - If true use a legacy network adapter as the NIC.
  This defaults to false. A legacy network adapter is fully emulated NIC, and is thus
  supported by various exotic operating systems, but this emulation requires
  additional overhead and should only be used if absolutely necessary.

- `differencing_disk` (bool) - If true enables differencing disks. Only
  the changes will be written to the new disk. This is especially useful if
  your source is a VHD/VHDX. This defaults to false.

- `use_fixed_vhd_format` (bool) - If true, creates the boot disk on the
  virtual machine as a fixed VHD format disk. The default is false, which
  creates a dynamic VHDX format disk. This option requires setting
  generation to 1, skip_compaction to true, and
  differencing_disk to false. Additionally, any value entered for
  disk_block_size will be ignored. The most likely use case for this
  option is outputing a disk that is in the format required for upload to
  Azure.

<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the Config struct in builder/hyperv/iso/builder.go; -->


<!-- Code generated from the comments of the CommonConfig struct in builder/hyperv/common/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

- `disk_block_size` (uint) - The block size of the VHD to be created.
  Recommended disk block size for Linux hyper-v guests is 1 MiB. This
  defaults to "32" MiB.

- `memory` (uint) - The amount, in megabytes, of RAM to assign to the
  VM. By default, this is 1 GB.

- `secondary_iso_images` ([]string) - A list of ISO paths to
  attach to a VM when it is booted. This is most useful for unattended
  Windows installs, which look for an Autounattend.xml file on removable
  media. By default, no secondary ISO will be attached.

- `disk_additional_size` ([]uint) - The size or sizes of any
  additional hard disks for the VM in megabytes. If this is not specified
  then the VM will only contain a primary hard disk. Additional drives
  will be attached to the SCSI interface only. The builder uses
  expandable rather than fixed-size virtual hard disks, so the actual
  file representing the disk will not use the full size unless it is
  full.

- `guest_additions_mode` (string) - If set to attach then attach and
  mount the ISO image specified in guest_additions_path. If set to
  none then guest additions are not attached and mounted; This is the
  default.

- `guest_additions_path` (string) - The path to the ISO image for guest
  additions.

- `vm_name` (string) - This is the name of the new virtual machine,
  without the file extension. By default this is "packer-BUILDNAME",
  where "BUILDNAME" is the name of the build.

- `switch_name` (string) - The name of the switch to connect the virtual
  machine to. By default, leaving this value unset will cause Packer to
  try and determine the switch to use by looking for an external switch
  that is up and running.

- `switch_vlan_id` (string) - This is the VLAN of the virtual switch's
  network card. By default none is set. If none is set then a VLAN is not
  set on the switch's network card. If this value is set it should match
  the VLAN specified in by vlan_id.

- `mac_address` (string) - This allows a specific MAC address to be used on
  the default virtual network card. The MAC address must be a string with
  no delimiters, for example "0000deadbeef".

- `vlan_id` (string) - This is the VLAN of the virtual machine's network
  card for the new virtual machine. By default none is set. If none is set
  then VLANs are not set on the virtual machine's network card.

- `cpus` (uint) - The number of CPUs the virtual machine should use. If
  this isn't specified, the default is 1 CPU.

- `generation` (uint) - The Hyper-V generation for the virtual machine. By
  default, this is 1. Generation 2 Hyper-V virtual machines do not support
  floppy drives. In this scenario use secondary_iso_images instead. Hard
  drives and DVD drives will also be SCSI and not IDE.

- `enable_mac_spoofing` (bool) - If true enable MAC address spoofing
  for the virtual machine. This defaults to false.

- `enable_dynamic_memory` (bool) - If true enable dynamic memory for
  the virtual machine. This defaults to false.

- `enable_secure_boot` (bool) - If true enable secure boot for the
  virtual machine. This defaults to false. See secure_boot_template
  below for additional settings.

- `secure_boot_template` (string) - The secure boot template to be
  configured. Valid values are "MicrosoftWindows" (Windows) or
  "MicrosoftUEFICertificateAuthority" (Linux). This only takes effect if
  enable_secure_boot is set to "true". This defaults to "MicrosoftWindows".

- `enable_virtualization_extensions` (bool) - If true enable
  virtualization extensions for the virtual machine. This defaults to
  false. For nested virtualization you need to enable MAC spoofing,
  disable dynamic memory and have at least 4GB of RAM assigned to the
  virtual machine.

- `enable_tpm` (bool) - If true enable a virtual TPM for the
  virtual machine. This defaults to false.

- `temp_path` (string) - The location under which Packer will create a directory to house all the
  VM files and folders during the build. By default `%TEMP%` is used
  which, for most systems, will evaluate to
  `%USERPROFILE%/AppData/Local/Temp`.
  
  The build directory housed under `temp_path` will have a name similar to
  `packerhv1234567`. The seven digit number at the end of the name is
  automatically generated by Packer to ensure the directory name is
  unique.

- `configuration_version` (string) - This allows you to set the vm version when calling New-VM to generate
  the vm.

- `keep_registered` (bool) - If "true", Packer will not delete the VM from
  The Hyper-V manager.

- `skip_compaction` (bool) - If true skip compacting the hard disk for
  the virtual machine when exporting. This defaults to false.

- `skip_export` (bool) - If true Packer will skip the export of the VM.
  If you are interested only in the VHD/VHDX files, you can enable this
  option. The resulting VHD/VHDX file will be output to
  <output_directory>/Virtual Hard Disks. By default this option is false
  and Packer will export the VM to output_directory.

- `headless` (bool) - Packer defaults to building Hyper-V virtual
  machines by launching a GUI that shows the console of the machine being
  built. When this value is set to true, the machine will start without a
  console.

- `first_boot_device` (string) - When configured, determines the device or device type that is given preferential
  treatment when choosing a boot device.
  
  For Generation 1:
    - `IDE`
    - `CD` *or* `DVD`
    - `Floppy`
    - `NET`
  
  For Generation 2:
    - `IDE:x:y`
    - `SCSI:x:y`
    - `CD` *or* `DVD`
    - `NET`

- `boot_order` ([]string) - When configured, the boot order determines the order of the devices
  from which to boot.
  
  The device name must be in the form of `SCSI:x:y`, for example,
  to boot from the first scsi device use `SCSI:0:0`.
  
  **NB** You should also set `first_boot_device` (e.g. `DVD`).
  
  **NB** Although the VM will have this initial boot order, the OS can
  change it, for example, Ubuntu 18.04 will modify the boot order to
  include itself as the first boot option.
  
  **NB** This only works for Generation 2 machines.

## Http directory configuration reference

<!-- Code generated from the comments of the HTTPConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/http_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

Packer will create an http server serving `http_directory` when it is set, a
random free port will be selected and the architecture of the directory
referenced will be available in your builder.

Example usage from a builder:

```
wget http://{{ .HTTPIP }}:{{ .HTTPPort }}/foo/bar/preseed.cfg
```

<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the HTTPConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/http_config.go; -->


### Optional:

<!-- Code generated from the comments of the HTTPConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/http_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

- `http_directory` (string) - Path to a directory to serve using an HTTP server. The files in this
  directory will be available over HTTP that will be requestable from the
  virtual machine. This is useful for hosting kickstart files and so on.
  By default this is an empty string, which means no HTTP server will be
  started. The address and port of the HTTP server will be available as
  variables in `boot_command`. This is covered in more detail below.

- `http_content` (map[string]string) - Key/Values to serve using an HTTP server. `http_content` works like and
  conflicts with `http_directory`. The keys represent the paths and the
  values contents, the keys must start with a slash, ex: `/path/to/file`.
  `http_content` is useful for hosting kickstart files and so on. By
  default this is empty, which means no HTTP server will be started. The
  address and port of the HTTP server will be available as variables in
  `boot_command`. This is covered in more detail below.
  Example:
  ```hcl
    http_content = {
      "/a/b"     = file("http/b")
      "/foo/bar" = templatefile("${path.root}/preseed.cfg", { packages = ["nginx"] })
    }
  ```

- `http_port_min` (int) - These are the minimum and maximum port to use for the HTTP server
  started to serve the `http_directory`. Because Packer often runs in
  parallel, Packer will choose a randomly available port in this range to
  run the HTTP server. If you want to force the HTTP server to be on one
  port, make this minimum and maximum port the same. By default the values
  are `8000` and `9000`, respectively.

- `http_port_max` (int) - HTTP Port Max

- `http_bind_address` (string) - This is the bind address for the HTTP server. Defaults to 0.0.0.0 so that
  it will work with any network interface.

<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the HTTPConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/http_config.go; -->


## Shutdown configuration reference

### Optional:

<!-- Code generated from the comments of the ShutdownConfig struct in shutdowncommand/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

- `shutdown_command` (string) - The command to use to gracefully shut down the machine once all
  provisioning is complete. By default this is an empty string, which
  tells Packer to just forcefully shut down the machine. This setting can
  be safely omitted if for example, a shutdown command to gracefully halt
  the machine is configured inside a provisioning script. If one or more
  scripts require a reboot it is suggested to leave this blank (since
  reboots may fail) and instead specify the final shutdown command in your
  last script.

- `shutdown_timeout` (duration string | ex: "1h5m2s") - The amount of time to wait after executing the shutdown_command for the
  virtual machine to actually shut down. If the machine doesn't shut down
  in this time it is considered an error. By default, the time out is "5m"
  (five minutes).

<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the ShutdownConfig struct in shutdowncommand/config.go; -->


## Floppy configuration reference

<!-- Code generated from the comments of the FloppyConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/floppy_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

A floppy can be made available for your build. This is most useful for
unattended Windows installs, which look for an Autounattend.xml file on
removable media. By default, no floppy will be attached. All files listed in
this setting get placed into the root directory of the floppy and the floppy
is attached as the first floppy device. The summary size of the listed files
must not exceed 1.44 MB. The supported ways to move large files into the OS
are using `http_directory` or [the file
provisioner](/packer/docs/provisioner/file).

<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the FloppyConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/floppy_config.go; -->


### Optional:

<!-- Code generated from the comments of the FloppyConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/floppy_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

- `floppy_files` ([]string) - A list of files to place onto a floppy disk that is attached when the VM
  is booted. Currently, no support exists for creating sub-directories on
  the floppy. Wildcard characters (\\*, ?, and \[\]) are allowed. Directory
  names are also allowed, which will add all the files found in the
  directory to the floppy.

- `floppy_dirs` ([]string) - A list of directories to place onto the floppy disk recursively. This is
  similar to the `floppy_files` option except that the directory structure
  is preserved. This is useful for when your floppy disk includes drivers
  or if you just want to organize it's contents as a hierarchy. Wildcard
  characters (\\*, ?, and \[\]) are allowed. The maximum summary size of
  all files in the listed directories are the same as in `floppy_files`.

- `floppy_content` (map[string]string) - Key/Values to add to the floppy disk. The keys represent the paths, and
  the values contents. It can be used alongside `floppy_files` or
  `floppy_dirs`, which is useful to add large files without loading them
  into memory. If any paths are specified by both, the contents in
  `floppy_content` will take precedence.
  
  Usage example (HCL):
  
  ```hcl
  floppy_files = ["vendor-data"]
  floppy_content = {
    "meta-data" = jsonencode(local.instance_data)
    "user-data" = templatefile("user-data", { packages = ["nginx"] })
  }
  floppy_label = "cidata"
  ```

- `floppy_label` (string) - Floppy Label

<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the FloppyConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/floppy_config.go; -->


### CD configuration reference

<!-- Code generated from the comments of the CDConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/extra_iso_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

- `cd_files` ([]string) - A list of files to place onto a CD that is attached when the VM is
  booted. This can include either files or directories; any directories
  will be copied onto the CD recursively, preserving directory structure
  hierarchy. Symlinks will have the link's target copied into the directory
  tree on the CD where the symlink was. File globbing is allowed.
  
  Usage example (JSON):
  
  ```json
  "cd_files": ["./somedirectory/meta-data", "./somedirectory/user-data"],
  "cd_label": "cidata",
  ```
  
  Usage example (HCL):
  
  ```hcl
  cd_files = ["./somedirectory/meta-data", "./somedirectory/user-data"]
  cd_label = "cidata"
  ```
  
  The above will create a CD with two files, user-data and meta-data in the
  CD root. This specific example is how you would create a CD that can be
  used for an Ubuntu 20.04 autoinstall.
  
  Since globbing is also supported,
  
  ```hcl
  cd_files = ["./somedirectory/*"]
  cd_label = "cidata"
  ```
  
  Would also be an acceptable way to define the above cd. The difference
  between providing the directory with or without the glob is whether the
  directory itself or its contents will be at the CD root.
  
  Use of this option assumes that you have a command line tool installed
  that can handle the iso creation. Packer will use one of the following
  tools:
  
    * xorriso
    * mkisofs
    * hdiutil (normally found in macOS)
    * oscdimg (normally found in Windows as part of the Windows ADK)

- `cd_content` (map[string]string) - Key/Values to add to the CD. The keys represent the paths, and the values
  contents. It can be used alongside `cd_files`, which is useful to add large
  files without loading them into memory. If any paths are specified by both,
  the contents in `cd_content` will take precedence.
  
  Usage example (HCL):
  
  ```hcl
  cd_files = ["vendor-data"]
  cd_content = {
    "meta-data" = jsonencode(local.instance_data)
    "user-data" = templatefile("user-data", { packages = ["nginx"] })
  }
  cd_label = "cidata"
  ```

- `cd_label` (string) - CD Label

<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the CDConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/extra_iso_config.go; -->


## Communicator configuration reference

### Optional common fields:

<!-- Code generated from the comments of the Config struct in communicator/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

- `communicator` (string) - Packer currently supports three kinds of communicators:
  
  -   `none` - No communicator will be used. If this is set, most
      provisioners also can't be used.
  
  -   `ssh` - An SSH connection will be established to the machine. This
      is usually the default.
  
  -   `winrm` - A WinRM connection will be established.
  
  In addition to the above, some builders have custom communicators they
  can use. For example, the Docker builder has a "docker" communicator
  that uses `docker exec` and `docker cp` to execute scripts and copy
  files.

- `pause_before_connecting` (duration string | ex: "1h5m2s") - We recommend that you enable SSH or WinRM as the very last step in your
  guest's bootstrap script, but sometimes you may have a race condition
  where you need Packer to wait before attempting to connect to your
  guest.
  
  If you end up in this situation, you can use the template option
  `pause_before_connecting`. By default, there is no pause. For example if
  you set `pause_before_connecting` to `10m` Packer will check whether it
  can connect, as normal. But once a connection attempt is successful, it
  will disconnect and then wait 10 minutes before connecting to the guest
  and beginning provisioning.

<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the Config struct in communicator/config.go; -->


### Optional SSH fields:

<!-- Code generated from the comments of the SSH struct in communicator/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

- `ssh_host` (string) - The address to SSH to. This usually is automatically configured by the
  builder.

- `ssh_port` (int) - The port to connect to SSH. This defaults to `22`.

- `ssh_username` (string) - The username to connect to SSH with. Required if using SSH.

- `ssh_password` (string) - A plaintext password to use to authenticate with SSH.

- `ssh_ciphers` ([]string) - This overrides the value of ciphers supported by default by Golang.
  The default value is [
    "aes128-gcm@openssh.com",
    "chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com",
    "aes128-ctr", "aes192-ctr", "aes256-ctr",
  ]
  
  Valid options for ciphers include:
  "aes128-ctr", "aes192-ctr", "aes256-ctr", "aes128-gcm@openssh.com",
  "chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com",
  "arcfour256", "arcfour128", "arcfour", "aes128-cbc", "3des-cbc",

- `ssh_clear_authorized_keys` (bool) - If true, Packer will attempt to remove its temporary key from
  `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` and `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys`. This is a
  mostly cosmetic option, since Packer will delete the temporary private
  key from the host system regardless of whether this is set to true
  (unless the user has set the `-debug` flag). Defaults to "false";
  currently only works on guests with `sed` installed.

- `ssh_key_exchange_algorithms` ([]string) - If set, Packer will override the value of key exchange (kex) algorithms
  supported by default by Golang. Acceptable values include:
  "curve25519-sha256@libssh.org", "ecdh-sha2-nistp256",
  "ecdh-sha2-nistp384", "ecdh-sha2-nistp521",
  "diffie-hellman-group14-sha1", and "diffie-hellman-group1-sha1".

- `ssh_certificate_file` (string) - Path to user certificate used to authenticate with SSH.
  The `~` can be used in path and will be expanded to the
  home directory of current user.

- `ssh_pty` (bool) - If `true`, a PTY will be requested for the SSH connection. This defaults
  to `false`.

- `ssh_timeout` (duration string | ex: "1h5m2s") - The time to wait for SSH to become available. Packer uses this to
  determine when the machine has booted so this is usually quite long.
  Example value: `10m`.
  This defaults to `5m`, unless `ssh_handshake_attempts` is set.

- `ssh_disable_agent_forwarding` (bool) - If true, SSH agent forwarding will be disabled. Defaults to `false`.

- `ssh_handshake_attempts` (int) - The number of handshakes to attempt with SSH once it can connect.
  This defaults to `10`, unless a `ssh_timeout` is set.

- `ssh_bastion_host` (string) - A bastion host to use for the actual SSH connection.

- `ssh_bastion_port` (int) - The port of the bastion host. Defaults to `22`.

- `ssh_bastion_agent_auth` (bool) - If `true`, the local SSH agent will be used to authenticate with the
  bastion host. Defaults to `false`.

- `ssh_bastion_username` (string) - The username to connect to the bastion host.

- `ssh_bastion_password` (string) - The password to use to authenticate with the bastion host.

- `ssh_bastion_interactive` (bool) - If `true`, the keyboard-interactive used to authenticate with bastion host.

- `ssh_bastion_private_key_file` (string) - Path to a PEM encoded private key file to use to authenticate with the
  bastion host. The `~` can be used in path and will be expanded to the
  home directory of current user.

- `ssh_bastion_certificate_file` (string) - Path to user certificate used to authenticate with bastion host.
  The `~` can be used in path and will be expanded to the
  home directory of current user.

- `ssh_file_transfer_method` (string) - `scp` or `sftp` - How to transfer files, Secure copy (default) or SSH
  File Transfer Protocol.
  
  **NOTE**: Guests using Windows with Win32-OpenSSH v9.1.0.0p1-Beta, scp
  (the default protocol for copying data) returns a a non-zero error code since the MOTW
  cannot be set, which cause any file transfer to fail. As a workaround you can override the transfer protocol
  with SFTP instead `ssh_file_transfer_protocol = "sftp"`.

- `ssh_proxy_host` (string) - A SOCKS proxy host to use for SSH connection

- `ssh_proxy_port` (int) - A port of the SOCKS proxy. Defaults to `1080`.

- `ssh_proxy_username` (string) - The optional username to authenticate with the proxy server.

- `ssh_proxy_password` (string) - The optional password to use to authenticate with the proxy server.

- `ssh_keep_alive_interval` (duration string | ex: "1h5m2s") - How often to send "keep alive" messages to the server. Set to a negative
  value (`-1s`) to disable. Example value: `10s`. Defaults to `5s`.

- `ssh_read_write_timeout` (duration string | ex: "1h5m2s") - The amount of time to wait for a remote command to end. This might be
  useful if, for example, packer hangs on a connection after a reboot.
  Example: `5m`. Disabled by default.

- `ssh_remote_tunnels` ([]string) - 

- `ssh_local_tunnels` ([]string) - 

<!-- End of code generated from the comments of the SSH struct in communicator/config.go; -->


- `ssh_private_key_file` (string) - Path to a PEM encoded private key file to use to authenticate with SSH.
  The `~` can be used in path and will be expanded to the home directory
  of current user.


### Optional WinRM fields:

<!-- Code generated from the comments of the WinRM struct in communicator/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

- `winrm_username` (string) - The username to use to connect to WinRM.

- `winrm_password` (string) - The password to use to connect to WinRM.

- `winrm_host` (string) - The address for WinRM to connect to.
  
  NOTE: If using an Amazon EBS builder, you can specify the interface
  WinRM connects to via
  [`ssh_interface`](/packer/integrations/hashicorp/amazon/latest/components/builder/ebs#ssh_interface)

- `winrm_no_proxy` (bool) - Setting this to `true` adds the remote
  `host:port` to the `NO_PROXY` environment variable. This has the effect of
  bypassing any configured proxies when connecting to the remote host.
  Default to `false`.

- `winrm_port` (int) - The WinRM port to connect to. This defaults to `5985` for plain
  unencrypted connection and `5986` for SSL when `winrm_use_ssl` is set to
  true.

- `winrm_timeout` (duration string | ex: "1h5m2s") - The amount of time to wait for WinRM to become available. This defaults
  to `30m` since setting up a Windows machine generally takes a long time.

- `winrm_use_ssl` (bool) - If `true`, use HTTPS for WinRM.

- `winrm_insecure` (bool) - If `true`, do not check server certificate chain and host name.

- `winrm_use_ntlm` (bool) - If `true`, NTLMv2 authentication (with session security) will be used
  for WinRM, rather than default (basic authentication), removing the
  requirement for basic authentication to be enabled within the target
  guest. Further reading for remote connection authentication can be found
  [here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa384295(v=vs.85).aspx).

## Boot Configuration Reference

<!-- Code generated from the comments of the BootConfig struct in bootcommand/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

The boot configuration is very important: `boot_command` specifies the keys
to type when the virtual machine is first booted in order to start the OS
installer. This command is typed after boot_wait, which gives the virtual
machine some time to actually load.

The boot_command is an array of strings. The strings are all typed in
sequence. It is an array only to improve readability within the template.

There are a set of special keys available. If these are in your boot
command, they will be replaced by the proper key:

-   `<bs>` - Backspace

-   `<del>` - Delete

-   `<enter> <return>` - Simulates an actual "enter" or "return" keypress.

-   `<esc>` - Simulates pressing the escape key.

-   `<tab>` - Simulates pressing the tab key.

-   `<f1> - <f12>` - Simulates pressing a function key.

-   `<up> <down> <left> <right>` - Simulates pressing an arrow key.

-   `<spacebar>` - Simulates pressing the spacebar.

-   `<insert>` - Simulates pressing the insert key.

-   `<home> <end>` - Simulates pressing the home and end keys.

  - `<pageUp> <pageDown>` - Simulates pressing the page up and page down
    keys.

-   `<menu>` - Simulates pressing the Menu key.

-   `<leftAlt> <rightAlt>` - Simulates pressing the alt key.

-   `<leftCtrl> <rightCtrl>` - Simulates pressing the ctrl key.

-   `<leftShift> <rightShift>` - Simulates pressing the shift key.

-   `<leftSuper> <rightSuper>` - Simulates pressing the ⌘ or Windows key.

  - `<wait> <wait5> <wait10>` - Adds a 1, 5 or 10 second pause before
    sending any additional keys. This is useful if you have to generally
    wait for the UI to update before typing more.

  - `<waitXX>` - Add an arbitrary pause before sending any additional keys.
    The format of `XX` is a sequence of positive decimal numbers, each with
    optional fraction and a unit suffix, such as `300ms`, `1.5h` or `2h45m`.
    Valid time units are `ns`, `us` (or `µs`), `ms`, `s`, `m`, `h`. For
    example `<wait10m>` or `<wait1m20s>`.

  - `<XXXOn> <XXXOff>` - Any printable keyboard character, and of these
    "special" expressions, with the exception of the `<wait>` types, can
    also be toggled on or off. For example, to simulate ctrl+c, use
    `<leftCtrlOn>c<leftCtrlOff>`. Be sure to release them, otherwise they
    will be held down until the machine reboots. To hold the `c` key down,
    you would use `<cOn>`. Likewise, `<cOff>` to release.

  - `{{ .HTTPIP }} {{ .HTTPPort }}` - The IP and port, respectively of an
    HTTP server that is started serving the directory specified by the
    `http_directory` configuration parameter. If `http_directory` isn't
    specified, these will be blank!

-   `{{ .Name }}` - The name of the VM.

Example boot command. This is actually a working boot command used to start an
CentOS 6.4 installer:

In JSON:

```json
"boot_command": [

	   "<tab><wait>",
	   " ks=http://{{ .HTTPIP }}:{{ .HTTPPort }}/centos6-ks.cfg<enter>"
	]

```

In HCL2:

```hcl
boot_command = [

	   "<tab><wait>",
	   " ks=http://{{ .HTTPIP }}:{{ .HTTPPort }}/centos6-ks.cfg<enter>"
	]

```

The example shown below is a working boot command used to start an Ubuntu
12.04 installer:

In JSON:

```json
"boot_command": [

	"<esc><esc><enter><wait>",
	"/install/vmlinuz noapic ",
	"preseed/url=http://{{ .HTTPIP }}:{{ .HTTPPort }}/preseed.cfg ",
	"debian-installer=en_US auto locale=en_US kbd-chooser/method=us ",
	"hostname={{ .Name }} ",
	"fb=false debconf/frontend=noninteractive ",
	"keyboard-configuration/modelcode=SKIP keyboard-configuration/layout=USA ",
	"keyboard-configuration/variant=USA console-setup/ask_detect=false ",
	"initrd=/install/initrd.gz -- <enter>"

]
```

In HCL2:

```hcl
boot_command = [

	"<esc><esc><enter><wait>",
	"/install/vmlinuz noapic ",
	"preseed/url=http://{{ .HTTPIP }}:{{ .HTTPPort }}/preseed.cfg ",
	"debian-installer=en_US auto locale=en_US kbd-chooser/method=us ",
	"hostname={{ .Name }} ",
	"fb=false debconf/frontend=noninteractive ",
	"keyboard-configuration/modelcode=SKIP keyboard-configuration/layout=USA ",
	"keyboard-configuration/variant=USA console-setup/ask_detect=false ",
	"initrd=/install/initrd.gz -- <enter>"

]
```

[community templates page](https://packer.io/community-tools#templates).

### Optional:

<!-- Code generated from the comments of the BootConfig struct in bootcommand/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

- `boot_keygroup_interval` (duration string | ex: "1h5m2s") - Time to wait after sending a group of key pressses. The value of this
  should be a duration. Examples are `5s` and `1m30s` which will cause
  Packer to wait five seconds and one minute 30 seconds, respectively. If
  this isn't specified, a sensible default value is picked depending on
  the builder type.

- `boot_wait` (duration string | ex: "1h5m2s") - The time to wait after booting the initial virtual machine before typing
  the `boot_command`. The value of this should be a duration. Examples are
  `5s` and `1m30s` which will cause Packer to wait five seconds and one
  minute 30 seconds, respectively. If this isn't specified, the default is
  `10s` or 10 seconds. To set boot_wait to 0s, use a negative number, such
  as "-1s"

- `boot_command` ([]string) - This is an array of commands to type when the virtual machine is first
  booted. The goal of these commands should be to type just enough to
  initialize the operating system installer. Special keys can be typed as
  well, and are covered in the section below on the boot command. If this
  is not specified, it is assumed the installer will start itself.

## Integration Services

Packer will automatically attach the integration services ISO as a DVD drive
for the version of Hyper-V that is running.

## Generation 1 vs Generation 2

Floppy drives are no longer supported by generation 2 machines. This requires
you to take another approach when dealing with preseed or answer files. Two
possible options are using your own virtual DVD drives, the cd_files option,
or using Packer's built in web server.

When dealing with Windows you need to enable UEFI drives for generation 2
virtual machines.

## Creating an ISO From a Directory

Programs like mkisofs can be used to create an ISO from a directory. There is
a [windows version of
mkisofs](http://opensourcepack.blogspot.co.uk/p/cdrtools.html) available.

Below is a working PowerShell script that can be used to create a Windows
answer ISO:

```powershell
$isoFolder = "answer-iso"
if (test-path $isoFolder){
  remove-item $isoFolder -Force -Recurse
}

if (test-path windows\windows-2012R2-serverdatacenter-amd64\answer.iso){
  remove-item windows\windows-2012R2-serverdatacenter-amd64\answer.iso -Force
}

mkdir $isoFolder

copy windows\windows-2012R2-serverdatacenter-amd64\Autounattend.xml $isoFolder\
copy windows\windows-2012R2-serverdatacenter-amd64\sysprep-unattend.xml $isoFolder\
copy windows\common\set-power-config.ps1 $isoFolder\
copy windows\common\microsoft-updates.ps1 $isoFolder\
copy windows\common\win-updates.ps1 $isoFolder\
copy windows\common\run-sysprep.ps1 $isoFolder\
copy windows\common\run-sysprep.cmd $isoFolder\

$textFile = "$isoFolder\Autounattend.xml"

$c = Get-Content -Encoding UTF8 $textFile

# Enable UEFI and disable Non EUFI
$c | % { $_ -replace '<!-- Start Non UEFI -->','<!-- Start Non UEFI' } | % { $_ -replace '<!-- Finish Non UEFI -->','Finish Non UEFI -->' } | % { $_ -replace '<!-- Start UEFI compatible','<!-- Start UEFI compatible -->' } | % { $_ -replace 'Finish UEFI compatible -->','<!-- Finish UEFI compatible -->' } | sc -Path $textFile

& .\mkisofs.exe -r -iso-level 4 -UDF -o windows\windows-2012R2-serverdatacenter-amd64\answer.iso $isoFolder

if (test-path $isoFolder){
  remove-item $isoFolder -Force -Recurse
}
```

-> **Warning:** Please note that if you're setting up WinRM for provisioning, you'll probably want to turn it off or restrict its permissions as part of a shutdown script at the end of Packer's provisioning process. For more details on the why/how, check out this useful blog post and the associated code:

## Example For Ubuntu Vivid Generation 2

If you are running Windows under virtualization, you may need to create a
virtual switch with an `External` connection type.

-> **Note for \*nix guests:** Please note that Packer requires the VM to be
running a hyper-v KVP daemon in order to detect the IP address of the guest VM.
On RHEL based machines this may require installing the package `hyperv-daemons`
and ensuring the `hypervkvpd` service is started at boot. On Debian based
machines, you may need `linux-cloud-tools-common` for `hv_kvp_daemon`. Failure
to do this may cause packer to wait at `Waiting for SSH to become available...`
before eventually timing out.

Also note that while the operating system is still being installed by a preseed
file, it is normal to see `Waiting for SSH/WinRM to be available` and
`Error getting SSH/WinRM host: No ip address` error messages until the system
is actually installed and ready to be connected to.

For more information about the hyper-v daemons and supported distributions, see
the Microsoft docs at
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/virtualization/hyper-v/supported-linux-and-freebsd-virtual-machines-for-hyper-v-on-windows
